"""Screenshots of the source video at the times Claude asks for.

A screen recording is variable frame rate: QuickTime and Cmd-Shift-5 write a
frame only when the picture changes, so a still screen can go many seconds
without one. The obvious ``ffmpeg -ss T -i video -frames:v 1`` returns the
next frame after T, which can be a screen the person had already left. So the
frame on screen at T is found first, from packet times, without decoding:

1. List the packet times just before T (``ffprobe -read_intervals``).
2. Take the largest at or before T. When there is none, look further back
   (10 s, then 60 s, then from the start).
3. Decode exactly that frame, with ``-ss`` set a hair before its time.

ffprobe's times are absolute and ffmpeg's ``-ss`` is relative to the file's
start time (some ``.mov`` files start at 5 s, say), so the start time is read
once and taken off. ``shown`` is relative, like ``at`` and the transcript.

Everything that is not ffmpeg is a plain function here: checking the times and
the region, choosing the frame, the crop box, the scale, the file encoding.
``ScreenFootage`` is the part that runs ffmpeg and ffprobe, and tests pass a
fake with the same three methods. ffmpeg's stderr goes to a log file in a temp
folder that is removed afterwards, as in look.py.
