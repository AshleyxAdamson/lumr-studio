"""How every MCP tool answers: shared by server.py and overlay_mcp.py.

One place for the three helpers both wiring modules need, so the overlay tools
answer and fail exactly the way the edit tools do. It lives apart from
server.py because overlay_mcp imports it and server.py imports overlay_mcp.

Results: for a returned dict, mcp 2.2.0 builds the text block with
``pydantic_core.to_json(indent=2)``, which pads every result by about 40%.
``result`` builds a ``CallToolResult`` instead: compact JSON (or a given text)
as the text block, and the full dict as ``structured_content``.
