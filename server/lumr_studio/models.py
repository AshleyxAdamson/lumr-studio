"""The models the plugin needs, and the one place that downloads them.

Two models, neither shipped with the plugin. Parakeet writes the transcript.
wav2vec 2.0 measures where each word sits in the sound. ``transcribe`` says
which are missing (``needs_models``) and the creator's yes starts
``download``. That function is the only code in the plugin that reaches the
network for a model. Everything else looks at files on disk.

A model is a few files, each pinned by exact size and sha256. ``download``
writes ``<file>.part``, checks size and sha256, then renames, so a file at its
real name is whole and was checked. A ``.part`` that a stopped download left is
picked up where it ended. Files land in the caches other tools share
(Hugging Face's, torch's), so an uninstall keeps them and a second tool finds
them.
