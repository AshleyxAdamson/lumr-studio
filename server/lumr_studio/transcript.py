"""Load, validate, and pack the speech model's ``<video>.words.json`` transcript.

The file is a JSON list. Each entry needs ``word`` (str), ``start`` and ``end``
(seconds). ``type == "event"`` marks a vocalization; a missing ``type`` means a
spoken word. Unknown extra keys (``energy_rms``, ``pitch_mean``…) are allowed.

Packing turns the word list into short text for the model: one line per
sentence or two, broken at pauses and sentence ends, so a long transcript reads
in a small budget and every line boundary is a sensible cut point.

The timing check spots transcripts whose word times were estimated (spread
evenly across a sentence) instead of measured.
