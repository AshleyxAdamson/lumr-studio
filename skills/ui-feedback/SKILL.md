# UI feedback

Turn a screen recording into a list of notes. The creator scrolls through an app or a website and talks through what they think. You read what they said, find the moment each thing was on screen, look at it, and write down what they want. The creator's meaning stays what it was. You never make an ask stronger or weaker than they said it.

You can't hear the recording, and you can't see it until you take a screenshot. Check what's on screen before you name it.

## Ground rules

- **The cursor is the creator's finger.** They point while they talk. In every screenshot, find the cursor before you read anything else: whatever it's on is what they mean by "this", "here" or "that". Say what's under it and where it sits. A screenshot you describe without finding the cursor is one you haven't read.
- Use the Lumr Studio tools for the video. Ordinary file and code tools are fine for the notes file and for fixes, but only after the creator says yes.
- Never delete a file. If the creator wants old screenshots cleared, tell them the folder and let them do it.
- Nothing is cut or rendered here. The video is never changed.
- To wait for a job, call `job_status` with `wait: 50`. Call it again if it's still running.
- Say this once, in your first reply: every screenshot you take goes into this conversation, the same way the transcript does. A screen recording can show emails, names, keys, or anything else that was open. If something on screen is private, the creator can tell you which parts to skip, and you'll leave those out.

## 0. Say up front what it needs

Lumr Studio uses two models on this Mac, and the first time they have to download. Say so in your first reply, in a few short lines, before you ask for the recording:

- **Parakeet** (NVIDIA Parakeet TDT 0.6B v2, 2.47 GB from Hugging Face) writes the transcript.
- **wav2vec 2.0** (0.38 GB from PyTorch's download site) times each word. For feedback this one is nice to have, not needed. Estimated times are close enough to pick screenshots.
- Together that's 2.85 GB, downloaded once and kept. Nothing downloads until they say yes, and you'll ask before it does.

Skip this if the creator says they've used Lumr Studio on this Mac before, or if a `transcribe` answer in this conversation already came back without `needs_models`.

## 1. Get the recording

Ask for the path to the recording. If they haven't recorded yet, tell them how: press Cmd-Shift-5, open Options, and choose a microphone. Then scroll through the app while talking. A recording with no voice has nothing to transcribe.

Call `transcribe` with the path. If the models aren't on this Mac yet, it answers `needs_models` and downloads nothing.

| The answer | Do |
|---|---|
| `status: "needs_models"` | Nothing has downloaded, and nothing does until the creator says yes. Ask first. See below. |
| `status: "downloading"` with a `job_id` | The creator said yes and the download started. Wait on `job_status`, and say how far along it is. When it's done, call `transcribe` again with the same path. |
| `job_id` | Wait on `job_status`. Tell the creator it transcribes and then times the words, about a minute more for a 20 minute recording. |
| `status: "aligning"` with a `job_id` | The transcript is there. The job times the words. Wait on it. |
| `status: "exists"` | Go on. |

On `needs_models`, ask before you do anything else. In a few short lines say what would download, from `models`: each name, what it does, its size in MB, where it comes from (`source_host`) and its license, then the total. If you already told them about the models in step 0, keep this short and just ask. Then stop and wait for the answer.

- **Yes:** call `transcribe` with the same path and `download_models` set to true. Wait on `job_status` with `wait: 50`, and call it again while it runs. Say the progress when you have it. If the job fails, tell the creator the error in one sentence and offer to try again. A stopped download picks up where it left off.
- **No to both models:** there's no transcript and nothing to read. Say so, say the speech model is what's needed, and stop. Don't download and don't look for another way.
- **No to the word timing model only:** if the answer has a `word_count`, the transcript is there. Go on with estimated word times. Tell the creator once, in one sentence, that the times are a little rougher and the screenshots may land a moment early or late.

If the result says `word_times: "estimated"`, go on. Don't retry and don't try to install anything. If it carries a `warning` about the transcript's own word timings, tell the creator in one sentence, then call `transcribe` again with `force` set to true and wait for it.

Ignore everything about paces. Nothing is cut here.

## 2. Read the whole recording first

Call `read_transcript` from the start. Each response ends with `NEXT <time>` or `END`. On `NEXT`, call again with that time as `start`. Keep going until you see `END`.

Don't write a note until you've read all of it. People take things back later: "actually, ignore what I said about the header." A note written on half the recording can be wrong.

While you read, notice where the creator moves from one screen to the next, and what they say about each. You'll use that to name the screens.

## 3. Split it into notes

A note is one thing the creator wants changed, a bug, a question, or something they like.

- One sentence can hold two notes. Several sentences can be one note.
- A line like "okay, now I'm scrolling down to pricing" isn't a note. It says where they are. Use it to name the screen.
- Keep their words. Quote briefly. Never make the ask stronger or weaker than they said it. "Maybe a bit bigger" is not "make it huge".
- If they take something back later, drop that note, or mark it as changed and keep the last thing they said.
- Each note gets a start time and an end time, from the start and end times printed on the transcript lines.

## 4. Take screenshots

For each note, call `frames`. It takes source seconds and shows the frame that was on screen at each one. Take:

- one at the start of the note;
- one at each pointing word: "this", "here", "that", "these", "this button". Call `find_words` with those words to get their exact times. The cursor is on the thing as the creator says the word, so these screenshots are the ones that tell you what they mean;
- if they're talking about something they just scrolled past ("that last section"), one more about 1 to 2 seconds before the note starts;
- if the screen changes during a long note, one in the middle and one at the end too.

`frames` takes up to 6 times a call, so batch the notes next to each other. Use `region` to zoom in when the thing is small, such as small text, an icon or a form field. It takes `[left, top, right, bottom]` as fractions of the frame, from 0 to 1.

Don't take screenshots of stretches the creator said to skip.

## 5. Look, and name the element

For each note, look at its screenshots. Find the cursor first. The element under it is the one the creator means. Then say what's on screen and which element that is: its visible text, where it sits on the screen, and that the cursor is on it. If the cursor sits between things, or it's clearly resting somewhere while they talk about something else, say so and let their words decide.

If you can't tell which element they mean, mark the note "unclear" and ask. Don't guess. A wrong guess sends the fix to the wrong place.

## 6. Show the notes in chat

Write a numbered list. For each note:

- The time. Use the `clock` value from `frames`. Never work out minutes and seconds yourself.
- Their words, quoted briefly.
- What's on screen and which element.
- The ask, in one plain line.
- The kind: **change**, **bug**, **question**, or **keep**. Keep means they like it and it shouldn't change.
- The screenshot paths.

Then:

- The unclear notes, each as a short question.
- One line offering to save the notes as a file, and to start on the fixes. Both only if they want.

## 7. Save the notes, only on a yes

Wait for a yes. On a yes, write `ui-feedback/<video stem>.md` in the project the creator is working in, or where they say. The video stem is the recording's file name without its extension.

Write each note as a section: the time, their words, the screen and element, the ask, the kind, and the screenshots linked by the paths where `frames` saved them. Don't copy the screenshots unless they ask.

Never overwrite a file. If the name is taken, add `-2`, then `-3`, and so on.

## 8. Fix them, only on a yes

Wait for a yes. On a yes, work in the app's code one note at a time.

- Find the component from the screenshot. Search the code for the visible text first: a button label, a heading, a placeholder.
- Say which note each change is for. Keep each change small and about that one note.
- Skip the keep notes, and don't touch those parts.
- Skip any note still marked unclear until the creator has answered.
- When you're done, say what you changed for each note. If the creator can run the app, offer to compare it against the screenshot.

## Handling tool errors

Read the error message. It says what was wrong. Fix the call and retry once. If it fails again, tell the creator plainly what's wrong and what you'd need from them. Don't retry silently more than once, and don't guess at a fix you can't explain.
