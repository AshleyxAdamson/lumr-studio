# Builds the plugin's own Python environment from its locked package list.

#   build-env.sh <lock-dir>
#
# doctor.sh starts this detached, at SessionStart, when the environment isn't
# built yet. It does what `uv run --locked` does when the server starts, minus
# the server, so a kill of the server can't cut the build short. Claude Code
# waits 30 seconds for a server and then kills it, and a cold build takes
# longer than that. The wheels a killed try had finished stay in uv's cache, but
# a slow connection may never finish the largest one inside 30 seconds.
#
# The server's own `uv run` and this build use one environment. uv locks it
# (venv/.lock), so whichever comes second waits, then finds the packages
# installed. Nothing here can corrupt the other.
#
# This builds the plugin's environment only. It installs no system software.
#
# Needs CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT and CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA. <lock-dir> is the folder
# doctor.sh made to keep a second build from starting; it goes when this ends.
# If this is killed hard, the folder stays, holding the pid of a process that is
# gone or is no longer this script, and the next session takes it over.
# Plain POSIX sh, so it runs on the sh macOS ships.
