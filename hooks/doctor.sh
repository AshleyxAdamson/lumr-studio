# Lumr Studio first-run check. Runs at SessionStart.
#
# Silent when all is well, so it costs no context. When something's missing it
# prints one plain line per problem with the exact fix. Claude Code adds this
# output to Claude's context, and Claude tells the user. It never installs
# system software (uv, ffmpeg), and it always exits 0.
#
# The one thing it does besides look: on the first session it starts a
# background build of the plugin's own Python environment (see step 4).
#
# Why a hook: with no uv the MCP server never starts, so no tool could say so.
# The first start is the other reason. It builds a 300 MB environment and
# outlasts Claude Code's 30 second startup limit, which then kills the server
# and the build with it. Only a hook can build outside the server's lifetime,
# and say that a failed server is expected.
# Plain POSIX sh, so it runs on the sh macOS ships.

# The lock is a folder, because mkdir either makes it or fails, never both for
# two hooks at once. Once the build is running, the folder holds its pid. Until
# then it holds nothing, and a folder with no pid that is under a minute old is
# a hook in the middle of starting a build, so it counts as running.
#
# A pid alone proves little. After a reboot or a kill -9 the build is gone, its
# folder stays, and the number can go to any other process. So the pid counts
# only while that process's command is our build script. Anything else means
# the build died before it could clean up, and the next hook takes the lock
# over. Two hooks taking over in the same instant could both build. uv locks the
# environment itself, so the second waits and finds it built, and nothing breaks.
